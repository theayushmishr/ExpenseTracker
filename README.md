# Overview

ExpenseTracker is my first full-stack app.It’s basically a personal finance tracker.Here, you can log your income, track expenses, categorize them, and peek at summaries
while I learn Node JS, design patterns, SQLite3 and how to not completely break everything.

> Disclaimer: Don’t even try to run this. It probably won’t work

It’s messy, it’s growing, and I’m learning as I go. Think of it like a Tamagotchi… but for code and finances.

## Tech stuff

- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS (easier than css and i dont to right utilities)
- Database: SQLite3 (lightweight and easy, because I’m a beginner)

## TODOs

- [ ] Implement Update `TransactionRepository` & `TransactionService`
- [ ] Implement Soft Delete `TransactionRepository`
- [x] Implement validate props `TransactionService`
  - [x] Fix validate Error `feild method`
  - [x] refactor `ValidationError`
- [ ] Helper Function to Handle Non Error Objects `Error`.
